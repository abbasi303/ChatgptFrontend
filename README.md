# ChatgptFrontend

This project contains a simple front-end clone of ChatGPT that displays the conversation in a split screen. The right side shows the most recent prompts while the left side keeps the earlier part of the same chat. The interface is implemented with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript and does not connect to any backâ€‘end service.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. Type a message into the text box on the right and press **Send** or hit **Enter**. New prompts appear in the right panel. When more than five message pairs accumulate, the oldest ones automatically move to the left panel so you can easily scroll through long text.

No additional dependencies are required.
